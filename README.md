## Translations

If you would like to help translate WooCommerce POS into your language please check out the [WooCommerce POS Language Packs](https://github.com/kilbot/WooCommerce-POS-Language-Packs) repository.

## Developing locally

WooCommerce POS is a WordPress plugin which requires [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) 3.8+ and [WooCommerce](wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce) 2.2+.

To develop the plugin locally you will first have to set up a local server with WordPress and WooCommerce installed.
If this is your first time setting up a local development environment you may want to check out [Varying Vagrant Vagrants (VVV)](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV) or [Chassis](https://github.com/Chassis/Chassis).

### Installation

The following installation instructions assume you have `git`, `nodejs` and `grunt cli` installed. 
VVV comes bundled with these and a bunch of other goodies so it is the recommended development environment for WooCommerce POS.
If you have VVV intalled you should use `vagarnt ssh` to enter the virtual machine and then continue with the instructions.

Navigate to your local `wp-content/plugins` directory and clone the project. 
The recursive flag will init and update any submodules. 

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/kilbot/WooCommerce-POS.git woocommerce-pos
```

Then, navigate into the root directory of the project and install the dependencies.

```sh
cd woocommerce-pos && npm install && composer install
```

### Building the project

Once you have installed the project you will have all the files necessary to build and customise the plugin. Build tasks are automated by [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com).

```sh
grunt dev
```

To create a minified version of the project ready to deploy, use:

```sh
grunt deploy
```

This will create a zip archive of the plugin which you can then install via your WordPress admin.
