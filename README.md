## Developing locally

**This branch is currently being refactored, do not build this branch until it is renamed to master!!**

WooCommerce POS is a WordPress plugin which requires [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) 3.8+ and [WooCommerce](wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce) 2.2+.

To develop the plugin locally you will first have to set up a local server with WordPress and WooCommerce installed.
If this is your first time setting up a local development environment you may want to check out [Varying Vagrant Vagrants](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV) or [Chassis](https://github.com/Chassis/Chassis).

### Installation

Navigate to your local `wp-content/plugins` directory and clone the project.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/kilbot/WooCommerce-POS.git woocommerce-pos
```

Then, navigate into the root directory of the project and install the dependencies.

```sh
cd woocommerce-pos && npm install
```

### Building the project

Once you have installed the project you will have all the files necessary to build and customise the plugin. Build tasks are automated by [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com).

```sh
grunt dev
```

To create a minified version of the project ready to deploy, you should first change the app.staging directory in [Gruntfile.js](Gruntfile.js) and then build again using Grunt.

```sh
grunt staging
```
